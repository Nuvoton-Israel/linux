Nuvoton  SGPIO controller Device Tree Bindings
--------------------------------------------

This SGPIO controller is for Nuvoton BMC
Nuvoton BMC includes two sgpio module.
Each module can supports up 64 pin input and 64 pin output.

Required properties:

- compatible : Should be one of  "nuvoton,npcm7xx-sgpio"
	       or "nuvoton,npcm845-sgpio"
- gpio-controller : Marks the device node as a GPIO controller
- interrupts : Interrupt specifier, see interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt
- ngpios : number of nin_gpios GPIO lines and nout_gpios GPIO line.
- clocks : A phandle to the APB3 clock for SGPM clock division
- bus-frequency : SGPM CLK frequency

The sgpio and interrupt properties are further described in their respective
bindings documentation:

- Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt
- Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt

  Example:
	sgpio2: sgpio@102000 {
        	clocks = <&clk NPCM7XX_CLK_APB3>;
                compatible = "nuvoton,npcm7xx-sgpio";
                interrupts = <GIC_SPI 20 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
                gpio-controller;
                pinctrl-names = "default";
                pinctrl-0 = <&iox2_pins>;
                reg = <0x102000 0x200>;
		bus-frequency = <16000000>;
        	nin_gpios = <8>;
        	nout_gpios = <8>;
        	gpio-line-names="s1","s2","s3","s4","s5","s6","s7","s8";
        	status = "okay";
                };
